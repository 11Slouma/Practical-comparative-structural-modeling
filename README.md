## Introduction
Lase (AA) is a protein derived from Alteromonas haloplanktis, a marine bacterium known for its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. In this study, we embark on a molecular modeling endeavor to elucidate the structural features of Lase (AA) from Alteromonas haloplanktis. By employing computational tools and techniques, we aim to unravel its molecular architecture . this pipeline built an important number of homology-models protein starting from a template to a model of our target . This modeling method is based on [the Basic Modeling tutorial of Modeller] , and the choice of the template is taken from the structure with the highest sequence identity to the target sequence.
